KB and S1 are two propositional logic statements, that are constructed
using symbols A, B, C, and using various connectives. The above truth
table shows, for each combination of values of A, B, C, whether KB and
S1 are true or false.
</p>

<p><strong>Part a</strong>: Given the above
information, does KB entail S1? Justify your answer.
</p>

<p><strong>Part b</strong>: Given the above
information, does statement NOT(KB) entail statement NOT(S1)? Justify
your answer.

<h2>Task 2 (CSE 4308: 8 Points; CSE 5360: 8 points)</h2>

<br>

Suppose that some&nbsp; knowledge base contains various
propositional-logic sentences that utilize symbols A, B, C, D
(connected with various connectives). There are only two cases when the
knowledge base is <span style="font-weight: bold;">false</span>:<br>

- First case: when A is true, B is false, C is false, D is true. <br>

- Second case: when A is false, B is false, C is true, D is false.<br>

<br>

In all other cases, the knowledge base is true. Write a conjunctive
normal form (CNF)&nbsp; for the knowledge base.<br>

<br>

<h2>Task 3 (CSE 4308: 24 Points; CSE 5360: 24 points)</h2>

A &lt;=&gt; B<br>

B =&gt; C<br>

D =&gt; A<br>

C&nbsp;AND E =&gt; G<br>

B =&gt; F<br>

E<br>

D<br>

<h2>Task 4 (CSE 4308: 30 Points; CSE 5360: 30 points)</h2>

On April 20, 2017, John and Mary sign the following contract:<br>

<br>

- If it rains on May 1, 2017, then John must give Mary a check for
$10,000 on May 2, 2017<br>

- If John gives Mary a check for $10,000 on May 2, 2017, Mary must mow
the lawn on May 3, 2017.<br>

<br>

What truly happened those days is the following:<br>

-&nbsp; it did not rain on May 1, 2017<br>

- John gave Mary a check for $10,000 on May 2, 2017<br>

- Mary mowed the lawn on May 3, 2017.<br>

<br>

<strong>Part a (10 pts)</strong>: Write a first order logic
statement to express the contract. Make sure that you clearly define
what constants and predicates that you use are. (NOTE: DO NOT use
functions)<br>

<br>

<strong>Part b</strong> <strong>(8 pts)</strong>: Write a logical
statement to
express what truly happened. When possible, use the same predicates and
constants as in
question 6a. If you need to define any new predicates or constants,
clearly define what
they stand for.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Part c</span><strong> (2 pts)</strong>:
Was the contract violated
or not, Justify your answer<br>

<br>

<strong>Part d </strong><strong>(10 pts)</strong>: Define the symbols
required to convert any KB involved in the above
domanin from FOL to Propositional logic. Use this to convert the
answers to part a and b to Propositional Logic.<br>

<h2>Task 5 (CSE 4308: 18 Points (+5 Points EC); CSE 5360: 18 points (+5
Points EC))</h2>

Three adults and three children are on the left side of the river. Each
adult
weighs 150 pounds. Each child has half the weight of an adult, so each
child weighs 75 pounds. They all want to cross to the right side of the
river. However, the only means of transportation they can use is a
boat, and the boat can carry a maximum of 225 pounds. Thus, the boat
can carry one adult, one adult and one child, one child or two
children.
Any adult or child can operate the boat, but the boat cannot be
operated without having at least one person on the boat. The goal is to
come up with a plan for moving everyone from the left side to the right
side using multiple boat trips.
<br>

<br>

Describe the initial state and the goal, using PDDL.
Define
appropriate actions for this planning problem, in the PDDL language.
For each action, provide a name, arguments, preconditions, and effects.
<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra Credit (5 pts)</span>: Also,
give a complete plan (using the actions described) for getting
from the start to the goal state<br>

<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Task 6 (CSE 4308: 10 Points; CSE 5360: 10 points)</h2>

Suppose that we are using PDDL to describe facts and actions in a
certain world called JUNGLE. In the JUNGLE world there are 4
predicates, each predicate takes at most 4 arguments, and there are 5
constants. Give a reasonably tight bound on the number of unique states
in the JUNGLE world. Justify your answer.<br>

<br>

<hr>
<h2>Task 7 (CSE 4308: 12 Points; CSE 5360: 12 points)</h2>

Consider the problem in Task 5. Let us say that, if there is only one
person in the boat, the boat can be blown off course and end up back on
the side it originally started from. How would you modify the actions
you described in Task 1 to account for this if you were going to try
and handle this scenario by<br>

<ul>

  <li>Execution Monitoring/Online Replanning</li>
  <li>Conditional Planning</li>
</ul>

In both cases, show what the modifications are (If no modification is
necessary, Justify). <br>
