Implement a search algorithm that can find a route between any two
cities. Your program will be called find_route, and will take exactly
commandline arguments as follows:<br>

<br>

<strong><em>find_route&nbsp;input_filename origin_city
destination_city</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>heuristic_filename</em></strong><br>

<br>

An example command line is:<br>

<br>

find_route&nbsp;input1.txt Bremen Kassel (For doing Uninformed search)<br>

or<br>

find_route&nbsp;input1.txt Bremen Kassel h_kassel.txt (For doing
Informed search)<br>

<br>

If heuristic is not provided then program must do uninformed search.
Argument
input_filename
is the name of a text file such as <a target="_blank" href="assmt1_files/input1.txt">input1.txt</a>,
that describes road connections between cities in some part of the
world. For example, the road system described by file input1.txt can be
visualized in Figure 1 shown above. You can assume that the input file
is formatted in the same way as <a target="_blank" href="assmt1_files/input1.txt">input1.txt</a>:
each line contains three
items. The last line contains the items "END OF INPUT", and that is how
the program can detect that it has reached the end of the file. The
other lines of the file contain, in this order, a source city, a
destination city, and the length in kilometers of the road connecting
directly those two cities. Each city name will be a single word (for
example, we will use New_York instead of New York), consisting of upper
and lowercase letters and possibly underscores.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT NOTE</span>:
MULTIPLE INPUT FILES WILL BE USED TO GRADE THE
ASSIGNMENT, FILE <a target="_blank" href="assmt1_files/input1.txt">input1.txt</a>
IS JUST AN EXAMPLE. YOUR CODE SHOULD WORK
WITH ANY INPUT FILE FORMATTED AS SPECIFIED ABOVE.<br>

<br>

The program will compute a route between the origin city and the
destination city, and will print out both the length of the route and
the list of all cities that lie on that route. It should also display
the number of nodes expanded and nodes generated. For example,<br>

<br>

find_route input1.txt Bremen Kassel<br>

<br>

should have the following output:<br>

<br>

nodes expanded: 12<br>

nodes generated: 20<br>

distance: 297.0 km<br>

route:<br>

Bremen to Hannover, 132.0 km<br>

Hannover to Kassel, 165.0 km<br>

<br>

and<br>

<br>

find_route input1.txt London Kassel<br>

<br>

should have the following output:<br>

<br>

nodes expanded: 7<br>

nodes generated: 7<br>

distance: infinity<br>

route:<br>

none<br>

<br>

For full credit, you should produce outputs identical in format to the
above two examples.<br>

<br>If a heuristic file&nbsp;is provided then
program must perform Informed search. The heuristic file gives the
estimate of
what the cost could be to get to the given destination from any start
state (note this is just an estimate). In this case the command line
would look like<br>

<br>

find_route input1.txt Bremen Kassel h_kassel.txt<br>

<br>

Here the last argument contains a text file what has the heuristic
values for every state wrt the given destination city (note different
destinations will need different heuristic values). For example, you
have been provided a sample file <a target="_blank" href="assmt1_files/h_kassel.txt">h_kassel.txt</a>
which gives the heuristic value for every state (assuming kassel is the
goal).
Your program should use this information to reduce the number of nodes
it ends up expanding. Other than that, the solution returned by the
program should be the same as the uninformed version. For example,<br>

<br>

find_route input1.txt Bremen Kassel h_kassel.txt<br>

<br>

should have the following output:<br>

<br>

nodes expanded: 3<br>

nodes generated: 8<br>

distance: 297.0 km<br>

route:<br>

Bremen to Hannover, 132.0 km<br>

Hannover to Kassel, 165.0 km&nbsp;<br>

<h3>Suggestions</h3>

Pay close attention to all specifications on this page, including
specifications about output format, submission format. Even in cases
where the program works correctly, points will be taken off for
non-compliance with the instructions given on this page (such as a
different format for the program output, wrong compression format for
the submitted code, and so on). The reason is that non-compliance with
the instructions makes the grading process significantly (and
unnecessarily) more time consuming.<br>

<h3>Grading</h3>

The assignments will be graded out of 75 points.<br>

<ul>

  <li>35 points: The program
always finds a route between the
origin and the destination, as long as such a route exists.</li>
  <li>15 points: The program
terminates and reports that no route can be found when indeed no route
exists that connects source and destination (e.g., if source is London
and destination is Berlin, in the above example).</li>
  <li>15 points: In addition to
the above requirements, the
program always returns optimal routes. In other words, no shorter route
exists than the one reported by the program.</li>
  <li>10 points: Correct
implementation of any informed search
method.</li>
  <li>Negative points: penalty points will be awarded by the
instructor and
TA generously and at will, for issues such as: submission not including
precise and accurate instructions for
how to run the code, wrong compression format for the submission, or
other failures to comply with the instructions given for this
assignment. Partial credit for incorrect solutions will be given ONLY
for code that is well designed and well documented. Code that is badly
designed and badly documented can still get full credit as long as it
accomplishes the required tasks.</li>
</ul>

Consider the navigation problem shown in Figure 2. The number next to
each
edge is the cost of the performing the action corresponding to that
edge. You start from A and your goal is to get to G. List the
order in which <span style="font-weight: bold;">nodes are expanded</span>,
which <span style="font-weight: bold;">nodes are added to the fringe</span>
and which <span style="font-weight: bold;">states are added to the
closed set</span> when performing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Graph
Search</span> using:<br>

<ul>

  <li>breadth-first search.</li>

<h2>Task 3</h2>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Max: [4308: 18 Points,
5360: 12 Points]</span><br>

<br>

A social network graph (SNG) is a graph where each vertex is a
person and each edge represents an acquaintance. In other words, an SNG
is a graph showing who knows who. For example, in the graph shown on
Figure 3, George knows Mary and John, Mary knows Christine, Peter and
George, John knows Christine, Helen and George, Christine knows Mary
and John, Helen knows John, Peter knows Mary.<br>

The degrees of separation measure how closely connected two people are
in the graph. For example, John has 0 degrees of separation from
himself, 1 degree of separation from Christine, 2 degrees of separation
from Mary, and 3 degrees of separation from Peter.<br>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">

  <li>From among <span style="font-weight: bold;">general tree search</span>
using breadth-first search,
depth-first search,
iterative deepening search, and uniform cost search, which one(s)
guarantee finding the correct number of degrees of separation between
any two people in the graph?</li>
  <br>
  <li>For the SNG shown in Figure 3, draw the
first three
levels of the search tree, with John as the starting point (the first
level of the tree is the root). <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Is there a one-to-one correspondence
between nodes in the search tree and vertices in the SNG (i.e. does
every node in the search tree correspond to a vertex in the SNG)? Why,
or why
not? In your answer here, you should assume that the search algorithm
does not try to avoid revisiting the same state.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Draw an SNG containing exactly 5 people,
where at least
two people have 4 degrees of separation between them.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Draw an SNG containing exactly 5 people,
where all
people have 1 degree of separation between them.</li>
  <br>
  <li>In an implementation of
breadth-first tree
search for
finding degrees of separation, suppose that every node in the search
tree takes 1KB of memory. Suppose that the SNG contains one million
people. Outline (briefly but precisely) how to make sure that the
memory required to store search tree nodes will not exceed 1GB (the
correct answer can be described in one-two lines of text). In your
answer here you are free to enhance/modify the breadth-first search
implementation as you wish, as long as it remains breadth-first (a
modification that, for example, converts breadth-first search into
depth-first search or iterative deepening search is not
allowed).&nbsp;</li>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Max: [4308: 15 Points,

</span><br>

Consider
a search space, where each state can be a city, suburb, village, farm,
or
mountain. The goal is to reach any state that is a mountain. Here are
some rules on the
successors of different states:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Successors of a city are always suburbs.&nbsp;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Each city has at least one
suburb as a successor.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Successors of a suburb can only be cities, or suburbs, or
villages. </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Each suburb has at least one suburb as a successor.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Successors of a village can only be villages, or farms, or
mountains.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Each village has atleast one farm as a successor<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Successors of a farm can only be villages, or farms, or
mountains.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Each farm has at least one other farm as a successor. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Successors of a mountain can only be mountains.</li>
</ul>

Define the best admissible heuristic h you can define using only the
above information (you should not assume knowledge of any additional
information about the state space). By "best admissible" we mean that
h(n) is always the highest possible value we can give, while ensuring
that heuristic h is still admissible.<br>

<br>

Assume that any move from one state to another has cost
1.&nbsp;
<h2>Task 6 (Extra Credit for 4308, Required for 5360)</h2>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Max: [4308: 15 Points EC,

</span><br>

Figures 5 and 6 show maps where all the towns are on a
grid. Each town T has coordinates (Ti, Tj), where Ti Tj are
non-negative integers. We use the term Euclidean distance for the
straight-line distance between two towns, and the term driving distance
for the length of the shortest driving route connecting two towns. The
only roads that exist connect towns that have Euclidean (straight-line)
distance 1 from each other (however, there may be towns with Euclidean
distance 1 from each other that are NOT directly connected by a road,
for example in Figure 6).<br>

<br>

Consider greedy search, where the node to be expanded is always the one
with the shortest Euclidean distance to the destination. Also consider
A* search, where h(n) is the Euclidean distance from n to the
destination (remember that the next node is picked not based on h(n)
but based on f(n) = g(n) + h(n)). For each of the maps showing on
Figures 5 and 6, which of the following statements is true?<br>

<ul>

  <li>Greedy search always performs better than or the same as A*.</li>
  <li>Greedy search always performs worse than or the same as A*.</li>
  <li>Greedy search performs sometimes better, sometimes worse,
and sometimes
the same as A*, depending on the start and end states.</li>
</ul>

Justify your answer. For the purposes of this question, the performance
of a search algorithm is simply measured by the number of nodes visited
by that algorithm. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note that you have
to provide separate answers for
Figure 5 and for Figure 6</span>.<br>
