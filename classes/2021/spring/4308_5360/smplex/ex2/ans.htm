<li> Convert the following knowledge base to conjunctive normal
form:
<pre>A AND B<br>B =&gt; (A OR C)<br></pre>
<p>
<strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<pre><strong>A<br>B<br>(NOT B) OR A OR C<br></strong></pre>
<strong></strong>
<p></p>
</li>
<li> Consider the following knowledge base:
<pre>A<br>B<br>NOT A<br></pre>
Does this knowledge base entail the following sentence:
<pre>B OR C<br><br></pre>
Justify your answer.
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p><strong>The knowledge base given in this question is
not satisfiable, since it contains both A and NOT A. Since it is not
satisfiable it entails every possible statement, including B OR C.
</strong></p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li> Given a propositional-logic vocabulary with only four
symbols, A, B, C, D, how many models are there for the following
sentences? In other words, for each of those statements, determine how
many models that statement is true in. Note that each model is defined
by assigning boolean values to all four symbols A, B, C, D.
<p>(a) <tt>(A and B) or (B and C)</tt> <br>
(b) <tt>A or B</tt> <br>
(c) <tt>A &lt;=&gt; B &lt;=&gt;C</tt>
</p>
<p><strong>
Answer: </strong></p>
<p><strong>For each case, the number of possible models
that entail the given logical sentence are:
</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a): The following 3:
</strong></p>
<pre><strong>(A AND B AND C)<br>((NOT A) AND B AND C)<br>(A AND B AND (NOT C))<br></strong></pre>
<strong>(b): The following 3:
<pre>(A AND NOT B)<br>((NOT A) AND B)<br>(A AND B)<br></pre>
(c): The following 2:
<pre>(A AND B AND C)<br>((NOT A) AND (NOT B) AND (NOT C))<br></pre>

<li> Textbook exercise 7.6 (second edition), exercise 7.8
(third edition)
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p><strong>(a): XOR is another connective that people
often find useful. In general, what is useful or not useful is highly
subjective. People might also find it useful to define connectives for
the negation of AND, OR, IF, IFF, XOR.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>(b): Each connective is defined using a
truth table. For two symbols, a truth table has four rows, so there are
2^4 = 16 unique truth tables. Therefore, we can define up to 16 unique
binary connectives.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>(c): Consider the statement <tt>a and
not(b)</tt>. While a binary connective could be defined for this
statement, most people would probably find it more natural to just see
that statement written as <tt>a and not b</tt>.
</strong></p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li> Textbook exercise 7.8 (second edition), exercise 7.10
(third edition)
<p><strong> Answer: </strong></p>
<p><strong>(a): valid <br>
(b): neither <br>
(c): neither <br>
(d): valid <br>
(e): valid <br>
(f): neither <br>
(g): valid <br>
(h) (for 2nd edition only): neither <br>

Give a conjunctive normal form for sentence S.
<p><strong> Answer: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Here are some intermediate steps in
producing a conjunctive normal form, and the actual CNF: </strong></p>
<pre><strong>1. (B &lt;=&gt; C) AND (A =&gt; B)<br>2. (B =&gt; C) AND (C =&gt; B) AND (A =&gt; B)<br>3. ((NOT B) OR C) AND ((NOT C) OR B) AND ((NOT A) OR B)<br><br></strong></pre>
<strong></strong>

</li>
<li> What is the negation of each of the following sentences:
<pre>1. for-every x, exists y: son(x) = y<br>2. for-every x, for-every y: son(x) = y &lt;=&gt; father(y) = x<br></pre>
In your answers, any "not" may only appear after the last appearance of
a universal or existential quantifier.
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<pre><strong>1. exists x, for every y: son(x) != y<br>2. exists x, exists y: not (son(x) = y &lt;=&gt; father(y) = x)<br><br></strong></pre>
<strong></strong>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>Textbook exercise 8.8 (in both second and third edition).
<p><strong>Answer for exercise 8.8 in the 2nd edition:
</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is an extra axiom needed: </strong></p>
<pre><strong>(Male(x) and Spouse(x, y)) =&gt; Female(y)<br></strong></pre>
<strong></strong>
<p><strong>Answer for exercise 8.8 in the 3nd edition:
</strong></p>
<p><strong>No, <tt>not(Spouse(George, Laura))</tt>
does not follow from the given facts. We need the additional axiom: </strong></p>
<pre><strong>(Spouse(x, y) and (z != x)) =&gt; not(Spouse(z, y))<br></strong></pre>
<strong>If <tt>Spouse</tt> becomes a unary
function, then no additional axiom is needed. Then, the facts would be
written as:
<pre>Jim != George<br>Spouse(Laura) = Jim<br></pre>
and the statement <tt>not(Spouse(Laura) = George)</tt> can
be proven as follows:
<pre>((Spouse(Laura) = Jim) and (Jim != George)) =&gt; not(Spouse(Laura) = George)<br></pre>
If <tt>Spouse</tt> is a function, then it can only return
a single value for each argument (such as <tt>Laura</tt>).
</strong>
<p></p>
</li>
<li> Consider the technique of propositionalization. For each
of the following two knowledge bases, decide if propositionalization
can be applied successfully. If not, why not?
<pre>KB 1:<br><br>for-every x: king(x) and greedy(x) =&gt; evil(x)<br>king(John)<br>greedy(John)<br>brother(Richard, John)<br><br><br>KB 2:<br>for-every x: king(x) and greedy(x) =&gt; evil(x)<br>king(John)<br>greedy(John)<br>brother(Richard, John)<br>king(father(John))<br></pre>
<p>
<strong>Answer:
</strong></p>
<p><strong>For KB1, propositionalization can be applied
successfully because there are no functions.
For KB2, propositionalization cannot be applied successfully because
there are functions.
</strong></p>
<p></p>
</li>

<li> Textbook exercise 9.3 (in both second and third edition).
<p><strong>Answer:
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Only (b) is valid, because in (b) we replace
the existential quantifier with a variable that does not appear
elsewhere in the database, whereas in (a) we have replaced the
existential quantifier with a variable that already appeared in the
database, and in (c) we have introduced two new variables (Kilimanjaro
and BenNevis) instead of one.
</strong></p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li> Textbook exercise 9.4 (in both second and third edition).
<p><strong>Answer:
</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<pre><strong>1. {x/A, y/B, z/B}<br>2. none<br>3. {y/John, x/John}<br>4. none<br></strong></pre>
<strong></strong>
<p></p>
</li>
<li> Textbook exercise 9.19, parts (a), (b), (c) (second
edition), exercise 9.24, parts (a), (b), (c) (third edition).
    <p><strong>Answer: <br>
(a): (A) becomes: for every natural number x there exists a natural
number y such that x is greater than or equal to y.
<br>
(B) becomes: there exists a natural number y such that every natural
number x is greater than or equal to y.
<br>
(b): (A) is true: any natural number is &gt;= 0.
<br>
(c): (B) is true: If y = 0, then any natural number x is greater than
or equal to 0.</strong><br>
