<h2>Task 1 (CSE 4308: 60 Points; CSE 5360: 60 points)</h2>

The task in this programming assignment is to design appropriate
descriptions of facts, actions, and goals, using the PDDL language,
for two planning problems: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi" target="_blank">Tower of
Hanoi problem</a>, and the 7-puzzle problem (a variation of the
8-puzzle problem where two squares are clear instead of one). You will
use your descriptions as inputs to a Graphplan implementation. If your
descriptions are correct, Graphplan will produce appropriate plans.
<h3> Compiling and Running the Software </h3>

The Graphplan software can be downloaded from <a href="assmt4_files/graphplan.zip" target="_blank">graphplan.zip</a>.
See
the README file in that package for additional information. To compile
the software on <tt>omega</tt>, unzip the directory, and,
from that directory, type
<pre>make graphplan<br></pre>

Once the program compiles, it can be invoked from the commandline as
follows:
<pre>graphplan -o [operators_file] -f [facts_file]<br></pre>

For example:
<pre>graphplan -o block_ops.txt -f block_facts3.txt<br></pre>

<ul>

  <li>Argument <tt>operators_file</tt> specifies the
location of a text file containing definitions of actions. For example,
see <a href="assmt4_files/block_ops.txt" target="_blank">block_ops.txt</a>
for definitions of actions appropriate for the blocks world. </li>
  <li>Argument <tt>facts_file</tt> specifies the
location of a text file containing definitions of facts about the
environment, including objects (and types for those objects), general
predicates that are always true, initial state description, and goal
description. For example, see <a href="assmt4_files/block_facts2.txt" target="_blank">block_facts2.txt</a>,
    <a href="assmt4_files/block_facts3.txt" target="_blank">block_facts3.txt</a>,
and <a href="assmt4_files/block_facts4.txt" target="_blank">block_facts4.txt</a>
for example fact descriptions for the blocks world. </li>
</ul>

Once you start running the software, it will ask you three questions.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Just hit enter for each
question</span>, so as to use the default settings. If
your descriptions of actions and facts are correct, the program will
print out a plan achieving the stated goal.
<p>Note that the preconds in each fact file will contain both
statements that are always true in that domain (i.e., in the Tower of
Hanoi domain or the 7-puzzle domain), and statements that simply
describe the initial state for that specific planning problem. In
addition to the facts files for the specific planning problems you are
given, you will have to create a separate text file that includes all
the statements that must be present in ANY facts file for that domain.
</p>

<h3>Tower of Hanoi Description</h3>

A description of the Tower of Hanoi domain can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Wikipedia</a>.
In all problems that your program will be tested with there will be
five discs (called disk1, disk2, disk3, disk4, disk5) and three pegs
(called A, B, C). In all your facts files you will have to include both
a common part (defining objects and relations among objects) and a
plan-specific part (describing the initial state and goal for each
plan). Note that some of the five disks may not appear in some of the
planning problems.
<p>The two planning problems you have to solve are:
</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1</strong>
</p>

<pre>initial state:<br>(on disk1 disk2)<br>(on disk2 A) <br>(clear disk1)<br>(clear B)<br>(clear C) <br><br>goal:<br>(on disk1 B)<br>(on disk2 C)</pre>

<strong>Problem 2</strong>
<pre>initial state:<br>(on disk1 disk2) <br>(on disk2 disk3)<br>(on disk3 disk4)<br>(on disk4 disk5)<br>(on disk5 C) <br>(clear disk1) <br>(clear A) <br>(clear B)<br><br>goal:<br>(on disk1 disk2) <br>(on disk2 disk3)<br>(on disk3 disk4)<br>(on disk4 disk5)<br>(on disk5 A) <br></pre>

<h3>7-puzzle Description</h3>

7-puzzle is like 8-puzzle, except that there are only pieces numbered
from 1 to 7 (not from 1 to 8), and there are two clear squares on the
board. At any move, we can move a numbered piece to an adjacent clear
square.
<p>The two planning problems you have to solve are (X indicates
a clear square):
</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1</strong>
</p>

<pre>initial state:<br>123<br>456<br>7XX<br><br>goal:<br>123<br>X56<br>4X7</pre>

<strong>Problem 2</strong>
<pre>initial state:<br>XX7<br>654<br>321<br><br>goal:<br>123<br>456<br>7XX<br></pre>

<h3> Grading </h3>

This task will be graded for 60 points. Half the points will
correspond to your solutions for the Tower of Hanoi world, and the rest
will correspond to your solutions for the 7-puzzle problem.
Specifically, the point allocation is:
<ul>

  <li>30 points: defining facts and actions correctly. The
language that you define (i.e., the actions, objects, and general
statements that are always true) should be sufficient not only for the
specific plans that you are required to construct, but also for any
other planning problems that we can define in the Tower of Hanoi domain
or the 7-puzzle domain. As part of grading, we will also test your
solutions on planning problems that we will make up. </li>
  <li>30 points: solving the planning problems
you
are given (two for the Tower of Hanoi domain, two for the 7-puzzle
domain) + 1 additional problem per domain. You get 5 points for each
problem. If you solve all 6
correctly, you get 30 points.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Task 2 (CSE 4308: 15 Points (+10 Points EC); CSE 5360: 15 points
(+10
Points EC))</h2>

Consider the following scenario:<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 589px; height: 274px;" alt="Planning Task" src="assmt4_files/Planning.png"><br>
</div>

<br>

Your task is to get all the blue marbles in P1 and red marbles in P2<br>

<br>

The actions available are as follows:<br>

<ul>

  <li>You can move 2 marbles from P1 to P2 if they are each of
different colors (one blue or one red)</li>
  <li>You can move 2 marbles from P2 to P1 if they are of the same
color (either you can move 2 red or you can move 2 blue)</li>
</ul>

Give the PDDL description to represent the above as a Planning Problem.
Do not forget to also define and describe the predicates and constants
that your are going to use.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra Credit (10 pts)</span>: Also,
give a complete plan (using the actions described) for getting
from the start to the goal state<br>

<br>

<hr>
<h2>Task 3 (CSE 4308: 10 Points (EC); CSE 5360: 10 points)</h2>

Consider the problem in Task 2. Let us say that, when you move the
marbles, it is possible to sometimes end up moving only one of them
(You try to move 2 Red marbles from P2 to P1 but only end up moving
one). How would you modify the actions
you described in Task 2 to account for this if you were going to try
and handle this scenario by<br>

<ul>

  <li>Execution Monitoring/Online Replanning</li>
  <li>Conditional Planning</li>
</ul>

In both cases, show what the modifications are (If no modification is
necessary, explain why).<br>

<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Task 4 (CSE 4308: 15 Points; CSE 5360: 15 points)</h2>

Suppose that we are using PDDL to describe facts and actions in a
certain world called JUNGLE. In the JUNGLE world there are 4
predicates, each predicate takes at most 3 arguments, and there are 5
constants. Give a reasonably tight bound on the number of unique states
in the JUNGLE world. Justify your answer.<br>
