The assignment should be submitted via <a href="http://elearn.uta.edu/">Blackboard</a>.

<h3> Problem 1 </h3>
20 points.
<p> <strong>1a: (10 points)</strong>
Consider a first-order logic knowledge base that contains the following
statements (and no other statements) about the block world:
</p>
<pre>on(a,b)<br>on(b,c)<br>clear(a)<br></pre>
Suppose that we know that c is not on the table. Does the knowledge
base already contain this information, or do we need to add a
statement? If so, what statement do we need to add?
<p><strong>1b: (10 points)</strong>
Suppose that the knowledge base contains the exact same statements as
above:
</p>
<pre>on(a,b)<br>on(b,c)<br>clear(a)<br></pre>
However, suppose that (in contrast to question 1a), this knowledge base
is a STRIPS knowledge base, i.e., it follows the rules and assumptions
of the STRIPS language. As in 1a, suppose that we know that c is not on
the table. Does the knowledge base already contain this information, or
do we need to add a statement? If so, what statement do we need to add?
<p>If you gave a different answer than in question 1a, what
aspect of STRIPS caused the difference?
</p>

<h3> Problem 2 </h3>
20 points.
<p> We have state descriptions and action definitions written
following the conventions used in the graphplan software of <a href="pa4.htm">
programming assignment 4</a>. One of the actions is defined as
follows:
</p>
<pre>(operator<br> aaa<br> (params<br> (&lt;b&gt; ttt1) (&lt;c&gt; ttt1))<br> (preconds<br> (ppp1 &lt;b&gt; &lt;c&gt;) (ppp2 &lt;b&gt;) (ppp3 &lt;c&gt;))<br> (effects<br> (eee1 &lt;b&gt; &lt;c&gt;) (eee2 &lt;b&gt;) (del eee2 &lt;c&gt;) (del eee3 &lt;c&gt;)))<br><br></pre>
Suppose we are at a state S1 described as follows (again, using
graphplan syntax):
<pre>(A ttt1)<br>(B ttt1)<br>(C ttt1)<br>(ppp1 B C)<br>(ppp2 A)<br>(ppp2 B)<br>(ppp3 C)<br>(eee1 A C)<br>(eee2 C)<br>(eee3 C)<br>(eee3 A)<br></pre>
What is the state resulting from applying action aaa(B,C) to S1? Give a
complete specification.
<p></p>

<h3> Problem 3 </h3>
30 points.
<p>In some planning domain, at every state we can perform a
number X of different actions (no more than X, no fewer than X). Given
an initial state S1 and a goal G, the shortest plan (i.e., the plan
with the smallest number of actions) contains Y actions (Y is obviously
a non-zero positive integer). In the following questions, remember that
time complexity and space complexity for an algorithm are always
worst-case estimates. Also, remember that, in big-O notation, constant
factors do not matter: if a certain algorithm A is 10 times slower than
another algorithm B, regardless of the values for X and Y, then
algorithms A and B are considered to have equal big-O time complexity.
Finally, remember that basic search algorithms like breadth-first
search and depth-first search can be used to solve planning problems.
</p>
<p><strong>3a: (10 points)</strong>
Name an algorithm that gives us the best time complexity (in terms of
big-O notation) for finding the shortest plan?. What is that best time
complexity? Time complexity should be expressed in terms of X and Y.
Use big-O notation.
</p>
<p><strong>3b: (10 points)</strong>
Name an algorithm that (in terms of big-O notation) gives us the best
space complexity for finding the shortest plan? What is that best space
complexity? Space complexity should be expressed in terms of X and Y.
Use big-O notation.
</p>
<p><strong>3c: (10 points)</strong>
Is there a single algorithm that, in terms of big-O notation, gives us
both the best time complexity and the best space complexity? </p>
<p></p>

<h3> Problem 4 </h3>
30 points.
<p><strong>4a: (15 points)</strong> Suppose that we
have implemented a planning system where states, goals, action
preconditions and action effects are expressed using the STRIPS
language. Given a state S1 and an action A1, and given specific
parameters for A1 (as opposed to variables), is there a polynomial-time
algorithm (in terms of the size of the knowledge base and the size of
the preconditions for A1) that can compute whether the preconditions of
A1 are all true in state S1? If so, what is that algorithm? If not, why
not?
</p>
<p><strong>4b: (15 points)</strong> Suppose that we
have implemented a planning system where states, goals, action
preconditions and action effects are expressed using unrestricted first
order logic. Given a state S1 and an action A1, and given specific
parameters for A1 (as opposed to variables), is there a polynomial-time
algorithm (in terms of the size of the knowledge base and the size of
the preconditions for A1) that can compute whether the preconditions of
A1 are all true in state S1? If so, what is that algorithm? If not, why
not?
