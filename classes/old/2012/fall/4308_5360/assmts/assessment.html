<h1>CSE 4308 Assessment</h1>
<h2>
Due dates:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Written parts (part 1 and part 2): Tuesday October 23, 2012,
11:59pm.</li>
<li>Programming parts (part 3 and part 4): Monday October 22,
2012, 11:59pm.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
The goal of this assessment is to evaluate:<br>
<ul>
<li>theoretical understanding of inference methods for
knowledge bases that
use propositional logic, and</li>
<li>the practical ability to design and implement such
inference methods.</li>
</ul>
Four tasks need to be completed:<br>
<ul>
<li>Answering some written questions about propositional logic
inference
methods.</li>
<li>Formulating parts of an inference engine in pseudocode.</li>
<li>Designing a knowledge base to represent some specific known
facts about
an environment.</li>
<li>Implementing an inference engine in software.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Part 1: (50 points) Understanding knowledge bases and
inference methods.</h2>
Questions 1, 2, 3, of <a href="wa3.html">written assignment 3</a>.
<h2>Part 2: (50 points) Formulating an inference engine.</h2>
Questions 4, 5, 6, and 7 of <a href="wa3.html">written assignment 3</a>.
<h2>Part 3: (40 points) Data analysis and representation.</h2>
Create a knowledge base capturing the known facts about wumpus
environments that are stated in programming assignment 3 (40% of
<a href="pa3.html">programming assignment 3</a>).
<h2>Part 4: (60 points) Implementing an inference engine.</h2>
Implement an inference engine that can determine, given a knowledge
base and a statement, if given the knowledge base the statement is
definitely true, definitely false, or neither (60% of <a href="pa3.html">programming assignment 3</a>).
<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
In addition to the quantitative score of total points earned, there
will also be a qualitative grade for each part, and for the assessment
as a whole. The qualitative grade can have the following five values:
poor, fair, acceptable, goods, excellent. The qualitative grade, for
each of the four parts, and for the assessment as a whole, will be
assigned as follows:<br>
<ul>
<li>0%-29%: poor</li>
<li>30%-59%: fair</li>
<li>60%-74%: acceptable</li>
<li>75%-89%: good</li>
<li>90%-100%: excellent</li>
</ul>
<h2>Important Note</h2>
Undergraduate students achieving a semester grade of C or better, but
failing the assessment (below 60%) and documenting their circumstances
will be assigned a semester grade of I (incomplete) and may re-attempt
the assessment in the next semester. If the assessment is then passed,
the semester grade will be changed from I to the achieved grade.
