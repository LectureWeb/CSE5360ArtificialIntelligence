<h1>Programming
Assignment 5</h1>
<h3>
Due dates:<br>
Interim report: Tuesday 11/20/2012, 11:59pm<br>
Full assignment: Tuesday 11/27/2012, 11:59pm.</h3>
<h3> Summary </h3>
The goal in this assignment is to get practice on designing Bayesian
networks, estimating probability distributions in Bayesian networks,
and implementing Bayesian networks.
<p> </p>
<hr>
<h3> Part 1: Designing a Bayesian network graph</h3>
<strong>
20 points
</strong>
<p>George doesn't watch much TV in the evening, unless there is a
baseball game on. When there is baseball on TV, George is very likely
to watch. George has a cat that he feeds most evenings, although he
forgets every now and then. He's much more likely to forget when he's
watching TV. He's also very unlikely to feed the cat if he has run out
of cat food (although sometimes he gives the cat some of his own food).
Design a Bayesian network for modeling the relations between these four
events:
</p>
<ul>
<li> baseball_game_on_TV
</li>
<li> George_watches_TV
</li>
<li> out_of_cat_food
</li>
<li> George_feeds_cat
</li>
</ul>
Your task is to connect these nodes with arrows pointing from
causes to effects. No programming is needed for this part, just include
an electronic document (PDF, Word file, or OpenOffice document) showing
your Bayesian network design.
<p></p>
<hr>
<h3> Part 2: Learning Probabilities from Training Data</h3>
<strong>
20 points
</strong>
<p>For the Bayesian network of Part 1, the text file <a href="pa5_files/training_data.txt">
at this link </a><a>
contains training data from every evening of an entire year. Every line
in this text file corresponds to an evening, and contains four numbers.
Each number is a 0 or a 1. In more detail:
</a></p>
<ul>
<a><li> The first number is 0 if there is no baseball
game on TV, and 1 if there is a baseball game on TV.
</li>
<li> The second number is 0 if George does not watch TV, and 1
if George watches TV.
</li>
<li> The third number is 0 if George is not out of cat food,
and 1 if George is out of cat food.
</li>
<li> The fourth number is 0 if George does not feed the cat,
and 1 if George feeds the cat.
</li>
</a>
</ul>
<a>Based on the data in this file, determine the
probability table for each node in the Bayesian network you have
designed for Part 1. You need to include these four tables in the
drawing that you produce for question 1. You also need to submit the
code/script that computes these probabilities.

specifications of all probability distributions.</strong>
</p>
<h3> Part 3: Implementing a Bayesian Network</h3>
<strong>
60 points
</strong>
<p>For the Bayesian network of Figure 1, implement a program that
computes
and prints out the probability of any combination of events given any
other combination of events. If the executable is called bnet, here are
some example invocations of the program:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
To print out the probability P(Burglary=true and Alarm=false |
MaryCalls=false).
<pre>bnet Bt Af given Mf<br></pre>
</li>
<li>To print out the probability P(Alarm=false and
Earthquake=true).
<pre>bnet Af Et<br></pre>
</li>
<li>To print out the probability P(JohnCalls=true and
Alarm=false | Burglary=true and Earthquake=false).
<pre>bnet Jt Af given Bt Ef<br></pre>
</li>
<li>To print out the probability P(Burglary=true and
Alarm=false and MaryCalls=false and JohnCalls=true and
Earthquake=true).
<pre>bnet Bt Af Mf Jt Et<br></pre>
</li>
</ol>
In general, bnet takes 1 to 6(no more, no fewer) command line
arguments, as follows:
<ul>
<li> First, there are one to five arguments, each argument
specifying a
variable among Burglary, Earthquake, Alarm, JohnCalls, and MaryCalls
and a value equal to true or false. Each of these arguments is a string
with two letters. The first letter is B (for Burglary), E (for
Earthquake), A (for Alarm), J (for JohnCalls) or M (for MaryCalls). The
second letter is t (for true) or f (for false). These arguments specify
a combination C1 of events whose probability we want to compute. For
example, in the first example above, C1 = (Burglary=true and
Alarm=false), and in the second example above C1 = (Alarm=false and
Earthquake=true).
</li>
<li> Then, optionally, the word "given" follows, followed by
one
to four arguments. Each of these one to four arguments is again a
string with two letters, where, as before the first letter is B (for
Burglary), E (for Earthquake), A (for Alarm), J (for JohnCalls) or M
(for MaryCalls). The second letter is t (for true) or f (for false).
These last arguments specify a combination of events C2 such that we
need to compute the probability of C1 given C2. For example, in the
first example above C2 = (MaryCalls=false), and in the second example
there is no C2, so we simply compute the probability of C1, i.e.,
P(Alarm=false and Earthquake=true).
</li>
</ul>
The implementation should not contain hardcoded values for
all combinations of arguments. Instead, your code should use the tables
shown on Figure 1 and the appropriate formulas to evaluate the
probability of the specified event. It is OK to hardcode values from
the tables on Figure 1 in your code, but it is not OK to hard code
values for all possible command arguments, or probability values for
all possible atomic events.
More specifically, for full credit, the code should include and use a
Bayesian network class. The class should include a member function
called computeProbability(b, e, a, j, m), where each argument is a
boolean, specifying if the corresponding event (burglary, earthquake,
alarm, john-calls, mary-calls) is true or false. This function should
return the joint probability of the five events.
<h3>Interim report </h3>
The interim report should be submitted via e-mail to the instructor and
the TA, and should contain the following:
<ul>
<li>On subject line: "CSE 4308/5360 - Programming Assignment 5
- Interim report".
</li>
<li>On body of message: Your name and UTA ID (all 10 digits, no
spaces).
</li>
<li>On body of message, or as an attachment (in text, Word,
PDF,
or OpenOffice format): a description (as brief or long as you want) of
what you have done so far for the assignment, and any
difficulties/bottlenecks you may have reached (in case you encounter
such difficulties, it is highly recommended to contact the instructor
and/or TA for help).
</li>
</ul>
For purposes of grading, it is absolutely fine if your
interim report simply states that you have done nothing so far (you
still get the 10 points allocated for the interim report, AS LONG AS
YOU SUBMIT THE REPORT ON TIME). At the same time, starting early and
identifying potential bottlenecks by the deadline for the interim
report is probably a good strategy for doing well in this assignment
<p></p>

nodes in the Bayesian network, according to the problem description.
</li>
<li> 4 points: Using the correct direction for each arrow
in the Bayesian network.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Part 2:
<ul>
<li> 20 points: Estimating correctly each probability table
from the training data.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Part 3:
<ul>
<li> 30 points: Creating an executable that provides the
correct output for each input.
</li>
<li> 30 points: Correctly implementing the Bayesian network

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to submit</h3>
Submissions should be made using </a><a href="http://elearn.uta.edu/">Blackboard</a>.
<p>Submit a ZIPPED directory called <tt>programming5.zip</tt>
(no
other
forms of compression accepted, contact the instructor or TA if you do
not know how to produce .zip files). The directory should
contain source code, the answer for part 1 in a document, the answer
(and code) for part 2, and the code for part 3. The submission should
also contain a file called
readme.txt,
which should specify precisely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and UTA ID of the student. </li>
<li>Where the answers are for part 1 and part 2. </li>
<li>What programming language is used.</li>
<li>How the code is structured.</li>
<li>How to run the code, including very specific compilation
instructions, if compilation is needed. Instructions such as "compile
using g++" are NOT
considered specific. Providing all the command lines that are needed to
complete the compilation on omega is specific.</li>
</ul>
Insufficient or unclear instructions will be penalized by up to 20
points.
Code that does not run on omega machines gets AT MOST half credit (50
points).
<h3>Submission checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li> DID YOU INCLUDE the answer for part 1, answer AND code for
part 2, and the code for part 3?
</li>
<li> Is the code running on omega?
</li>
<li> Is the submitted zipped file called <tt>programming5.zip</tt>?
</li>
<li> Does the submission include a readme.txt file, as
specified?
</li>
</ul>
