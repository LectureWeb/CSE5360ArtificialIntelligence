<h2>Task</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The task in this
programming assignment is to implement an agent that
plays the Max-Connect4 game using search. Figure 1 shows the first few
moves of a game. The game is played on a 6x7 grid, with six rows and
seven columns. There are two players, player A (red) and player B
(green). The two players take turns placing pieces on the board: the
red player can only place red pieces, and the green player can only
place green pieces.<br>
<br>
It is best to think of the board as standing upright. We will assign a
number to every row and column, as follows: columns are numbered from
left to right, with numbers 1, 2, ..., 7. Rows are numbered from bottom
to top, with numbers 1, 2, ..., 6. When a player makes a move, the move
is completely determined by specifying the COLUMN where the piece will
be placed. If all six positions in that column are occupied, then the
move is invalid, and the program should reject it and force the player
to make a valid move. In a valid move, once the column is specified,
the piece is placed on that column and "falls down", until it reaches
the lowest unoccupied position in that column.<br>
<br>
The game is over when all positions are occupied. Obviously, every
complete game consists of 42 moves, and each player makes 21 moves. The
score, at the end of the game is determined as follows: consider each
quadruple of four consecutive positions on board, either in the
horizontal, vertical, or each of the two diagonal directions (from
bottom left to top right and from bottom right to top left). The red
player gets a point for each such quadruple where all four positions
are occupied by red pieces. Similarly, the green player gets a point
for each such quadruple where all four positions are occupied by green
pieces. The player with the most points wins the game.<br>
<br>
Your program will run in two modes: an interactive mode, that is best
suited for the program playing against a human player, and a one-move
mode, where the program reads the current state of the game from an
input file, makes a single move, and writes the resulting state to an
output file. The one-move mode can be used to make programs play
against each other. Note that THE PROGRAM MAY BE EITHER THE RED OR THE
GREEN PLAYER, THAT WILL BE SPECIFIED BY THE STATE, AS SAVED IN THE
INPUT FILE.<br>
<br>
As part of this assignment, you will also need to measure and report
the time that your program takes, as a function of the number of moves
it explores. All time measurements should report CPU time, not total
time elapsed. CPU time does not depend on other users of the system,
and thus is a meaningful measurement of the efficiency of the
implementation.

</div>
<h2>Interactive Mode</h2>
In the interactive mode, the game should run from the command line with
the following arguments (assuming a Java implementation, with obvious
changes for C++ or other implementations):<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">java
maxconnect4
interactive [input_file] [computer-next/human-next]
[depth]</span><br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">java maxconnect4
interactive input1.txt computer-next 7</span><br>
<ul>
<li>Argument interactive specifies that the program runs in
interactive
mode.</li>
<li>Argument [input_file] specifies an input file that contains
an initial
board state. This way we can start the program from a non-empty board
state. If the input file does not exist, the program should just create
an empty board state and start again from there.</li>
<li>Argument [computer-first/human-first] specifies whether the
computer
should make the next move or the human.</li>
<li>Argument [depth] specifies the number of moves in advance
that the
computer should consider while searching for its next move. In other
words, this argument specifies the depth of the search tree.
Essentially, this argument will control the time takes for the computer
to make a move.</li>
</ul>
After reading the input file, the program gets into the following loop:<br>
<ol>
<li>If computer-next, goto 2, else goto 5.</li>
<li>Print the current board state and score. If the board is
full, exit.</li>
<li>Choose and make the next move.</li>
<li>Save the current board state in a file called computer.txt
(in same
format as input file).</li>
<li>Print the current board state and score. If the board is
full, exit.</li>
<li>Ask the human user to make a move (make sure that the move
is valid,
otherwise repeat request to the user).</li>
<li>Save the current board state in a file called human.txt (in
same format
as input file).</li>
<li>Goto 2.</li>
</ol>
<h2>One-Move Mode</h2>
The purpose of the one-move mode is to make it easy for programs to
compete against each other, and communicate their moves to each other
using text files. The one-move mode is invoked as follows:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">java
maxconnect4
one-move [input_file] [output_file] [depth]</span><br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">java maxconnect4
one-move red_next.txt green_next.txt 5</span><br>
<br>
In this case, the program simply makes a single move and terminates. In
particular, the program should:<br>
<ul>
<li>Read the input file and initialize the board state and
current score,
as in interactive mode.</li>
<li>Print the current board state and score. If the board is
full, exit.</li>
<li>Choose and make the next move.</li>
<li>Print the current board state and score.</li>
<li>Save the current board state to the output file <span style="font-weight: bold;">IN EXACTLY THE SAME
FORMAT THAT IS USED FOR INPUT FILES</span>.</li>
<li>Exit</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sample code</h2>
The sample code needs an input file to run. Sample input files that you
can download are <a href="pa2_files/input1.txt">input1.txt</a>
and <a href="pa2_files/input2.txt">input2.txt</a>.
You are free to make other
input files to experiment with, as long as they follow the same format.
In the input files, a 0 stands for an empty spot, a 1 stands for a
piece played by the first player, and a 2 stands for a piece played by
the second player. The last number in the input file indicates which
player plays NEXT (and NOT which player played last). Sample code is
available in:
<ul>
<li>Java: download files <a href="pa2_files/maxconnect4.java">maxconnect4.java</a>,
<a href="pa2_files/GameBoard.java">GameBoard.java</a>,
and
<a href="pa2_files/AiPlayer.java">AiPlayer.java</a>.
Compile on omega using:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">javac
maxconnect4.java GameBoard.java AiPlayer.java</span><br>
<br>
An example command line that runs the program (assuming that you have
input1.txt saved in the same directory) is:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">java maxconnect4
one-move input1.txt output1.txt 10</span><br>
<br>
</li>
<li>C++: download file <a href="pa2_files/maxconnect4.cpp">maxconnect4.cpp</a>.
Compile on omega using:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">g++ -o maxconnect4
maxconnect.cpp</span><br>
<br>
An example command line that runs the program (assuming that you have
input1.txt saved in the same directory) is:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">maxconnect4 one-move
input1.txt output1.txt 10</span></li>
</ul>
The sample code implements a system playing max-connect4 (in one-move
mode only) by making random moves. While the AI part of the sample code
leaves much to be desired (your assignment is to fix that), the code
can get you started by showing you how to represent and generate board
states, how to save/load the game state to and from files in the
desired format, and how to count the score (though faster
score-counting methods are possible).
<h2>Measuring Execution Time</h2>
You can measure the execution time for your program on omega by
inserting the word "time" in the beginning of your command line. For
example, if you want to measure how much time it takes for your system
to make one move with the depth parameter set to 10, try this:<br>
<br>
time java maxconnect4 one-move red_next.txt green_next.txt 10<br>
<br>
Your output will look something like:<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
real&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0m0.003s</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
user&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0m0.002s</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
sys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0m0.001s</span><br>
<br>
Out of the above three lines, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">user</span>
line is what you should report.
<h2>Tournament</h2>
We will have a playoff-style tournament of peoples' submissions. We
will configure the depth argument for each submission so that a move is
made in at most one second on omega. In each matchup, two games will be
played, where each program will play first in one of the two games. The
cumulative score (total number of points won after two games) will be
used to determine the winner, and program efficiency will be used as a
tiebreaker.
<h2>Interim report</h2>
The interim report should be submitted via e-mail to the instructor and
the TA, and should contain the following:
<ul>
<li>On subject line: "CSE 4308/5360 - Programming Assignment 2
- Interim
report".</li>
<li>On body of message: Your name and UTA ID (all 10 digits, no
spaces).</li>
<li>On body of message, or as an attachment (in text, Word,
PDF, or
OpenOffice format): a description (as brief or long as you want) of
what you have done so far for the assignment, and any
difficulties/bottlenecks you may have reached (in case you encounter
such difficulties, it is highly recommended to contact the instructor
and/or TA for help).</li>
</ul>
For purposes of grading, it is absolutely fine if your interim report
simply states that you have done nothing so far (you still get the 10
points allocated for the interim report, AS LONG AS YOU SUBMIT THE
REPORT ON TIME). At the same time, starting early and identifying
potential bottlenecks by the deadline for the interim report is
probably a good strategy for doing well in this assignment
<h2>Grading</h2>
The assignments will be graded out of 100 points. There is also a total
of 25 possible extra credit points.<br>
<ul>
<li>10 points: Submitting the interim report according to the
instructions,
and on time.</li>
<li>25 points: Implementing plain minimax.</li>
<li>25 points: Implementing alpha-beta pruning.</li>
<li>25 points: Implementing the depth-limited version of
minimax (if
correctly implemented, and includes alpha-beta pruning, you also get
the 25 points for plain minimax and 25 points for alpha-beta search,
you don't need to have separate implementations for those). For full
credit, you obviously need to come up with a reasonable evaluation
function to be used in the context of depth-limited search. A
"reasonable" evaluation function is defined to be an evaluation
function that allows your program to consistently beat a random player.</li>
<li>(CSE 5360 only) 15 points: Include in your submission an
accurate table
of CPU runtime (for making a single move) vs depth, when the board is
empty. Document the number of measurements for each entry on the table.
All measurements should be performed on omega. Your table should
include every single depth, until (and including) the first depth for
which the time exceeds one minute. For CSE 4308 students, this part is
optional, they get 15 points no matter whether they do it or not.</li>
<li>Optional, 10 points, extra credit. What is the max depth
(in
depth-limited search) that allows your program to make a move (as
measured on an empty board) in at most 1 second on omega, WHILE STILL
IMPLEMENTING A REASONABLE HEURISTIC? Report your result in your
submission. The top 3 results (as verified by the TA and instructor)
will get 10 points each.</li>
<li>15 points extra credit: Tournament first-place winner (One
for 4308 and one for 5360).</li>
<li>10 points extra credit: Tournament second-place winner (One
for 4308 and one for 5360).</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to submit</h2>
Submissions should be made using Blackboard. Implementations in Python,
C, C++, and Java will be accepted. If you would like to use another
language, please first check with the instructor via e-mail. Points
will be taken off for failure to comply with this requirement.<br>
<br>
Submit a ZIPPED directory called programming2.zip (no other forms of
compression accepted, contact the instructor or TA if you do not know
how to produce .zip files). The directory should contain source code.
Including binaries is optional. The submission should also contain a
file called readme.txt, which should specify precisely:
<ul>
<li>Name and UTA ID of the student.</li>
<li>What programming language is used.</li>
<li>How the code is structured.</li>
<li>How to run the code, including very specific compilation
instructions.
Instructions such as "compile using g++" are NOT considered specific.
Providing all the command lines that are needed to complete the
compilation on omega is specific.</li>
<li>What, if any, extra credit parts were done, and details
about the
method and the results.</li>
</ul>
Insufficient or unclear instructions will be penalized by up to 20
points. Code that does not run on omega machines gets AT MOST half
credit (50 points).
<h2>Submission checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is the code running on omega?</li>
<li>Is the submitted zipped file called programming2.zip?</li>
<li>Does the submission include a readme.txt file, as
specified?
</li>
</ul>
