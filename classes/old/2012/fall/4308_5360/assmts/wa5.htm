<h3> Problem 1 </h3>
<strong>10 points.
</strong>
<p> On the network shown in Figure 1, consider the event E =
"battery
age is less than three years". Let A = P(E | "battery dead"=true AND
"no oil"=true) and B = P(E | "battery dead"=true AND "no oil"=false).
Which of the following three cases can possibly be true: A &gt; B,
A =
B, or A &lt; B? Why?
</p>
<p></p>

<h3> Problem 2 </h3>
<strong>10 points.
</strong>
<p> On the network shown in Figure 1, consider again the event E
=
"battery age is less than three years". Let A = P(E | "battery
dead"=true AND "no oil"=true) and B = P(E | "battery dead"=true AND
"starter broken"=true). Which of the following three cases can possibly
be true: A &gt; B, A = B, or A &lt; B? Why?
</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h3> Problem 3 </h3>
<strong>10 points.
</strong>
<p> The "alternator broken" event and the "fanbelt broken" event
are
both causes of the "no charging event." Let A = P("alternator
broken"=true | "no charging"=true) and B = P("alternator broken"=true |
"no charging"=true AND "fanbelt broken"=true). Which of the following
three cases do you expect to be true: A &gt; B, A = B, or A
&lt; B?
Why?
</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h3> Problem 4 </h3>
<strong>10 points.
</strong>
<p> On the network shown in Figure 1, the "no gas" event is a
cause of
the "car won't start" event. Let A = P("no gas"=true) and B = P("no
gas"=true | "car won't start"=true). Which of the following three cases
do you expect to be true: A &gt; B, A = B, or A &lt; B? Why?
</p>
<p></p>

<h3> Problem 5 </h3>
<strong>20 points.
</strong>
<p> On the network shown in Figure 1, suppose that:
</p>
<ul>
<li> P("alternator broken"=true) = 0.02
</li>
<li>P("no charging"=true | "alternator broken"=true) = 0.95
</li>
<li>P("no charging"=true | "alternator broken"=false) = 0.01.
</li>
</ul>
What is P("no charging"=false)? How is it derived?
<p></p>
<hr>
<h3> Problem 6 </h3>
<strong>20 points.
</strong>
<p> Suppose that:
</p>
<ul>
<li> P("battery age" &lt;= 3 years) = 0.7
</li>
<li>P("battery dead"=true | "battery age" &lt;= 3 years) =
0.02
</li>
<li>P("battery dead"=true | "battery age" &gt; 3 years) =
0.1.
</li>
</ul>
What is P("battery age" &lt;= 3 years | "battery dead"=true)? How
is it derived?

<h3> Problem 7 </h3>
<strong>10 points.
</strong>
<p> On the network shown in Figure 2, what is the probability of
the
following event: burglary=false AND earthquake=true AND alarm=false AND
JohnCalls=true AND MaryCalls=false.
</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h3> Problem 8 </h3>
<strong>10 points.
</strong>
<p> On the network shown in Figure 2, what is the probability of
the
following event: earthquake=true AND alarm=false AND JohnCalls=true AND
MaryCalls=false.
