<h1>Written Assignment 3</h1>
<h2>Due date: <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Tuesday 10/23/2012</span> Friday 10/26/2012, 11:59 PM.</h2>
The assignment should be submitted via <a href="http://elearn.uta.edu">Blackboard</a>.<br><br>The questions in this assignment refer to the same problem as
<a href="pa3.html">programming assignment 3</a>,
please refer to the description of that
assignment for additional details. Also, please note that, for CSE 4308
students, written assignment 3 and programming assignment 3 together
will be used as the <a href="assessment.html">CSE 4308 assessment</a>, worth 6.7% of the grade.<br>

<h2>Problem 1</h2>
10 points.<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>(5 points) Are there inference algorithms for propositional
logic
that are sound and complete?<br>
</li>
<li>(5 points) If you answered yes for 1a, what aspects of
propositional logic make it possible to have such algorithms? If you
answered no, what aspects of propositional logic make it impossible to
have such algorithms?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Problem 2</h2>
20 points.<br>
<br>
Suppose that an agent using the program described in <a href="pa3.html">programming assignment 3</a> for inference, has gone through squares (1,1), (1,2),
(1,3), (1,4) sensing no stench or breeze anywhere, except for a stench
at square (1,4). You can assume that an agent dies if it moves to a
square containing a monster or a pit, and that this particular agent
did not die at any of the four squares. Specify a set of statements
that we need to add to the knowledge base to represent the information
that the agent collected out of those four squares. The set of
statements should be sufficient, meaning that the inference engine will
always give results that are correct and consistent with the
information that the agent obtained from those four squares. Your set
of statements should also be MINIMAL, i.e., it should not be possible
to leave out any of those statements without sacrificing the
correctness of the inference algorithm. You should assume that the
knowledge base already contains the wumpus rules, and in particular the
version of the rules specified in programming assignment 3, not the
version specified in the textbook.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>Problem 3</h2>
20 points.<br>
<br>
Suppose that your agent has already been through 12 of the 16 squares,
and that your knowledge base has been updated accordingly. What can you
say about the efficiency of inference in this knowledge base, compared
to the efficiency of inference in a knowledge base where the agent has
only been at square (1,1) and nothing (except for the wumpus rules) is
known about the rest of the squares? What quantity determines the
worst-case efficiency of the algorithm? What is the value of that
quantity in each of the two cases? How can you exploit the information
from the 12 squares to speed up inference?<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>Problem 4</h2>
5 points.<br>
<br>
Name two inference algorithms for propositional logic that can be used
to implement the inference engine in <a href="pa3.html">programming
assignment 3.<br>
</a><br>
<hr>
<h2>Problem 5</h2>
10 points.<br>
<br>
Suppose that you have a function f(kb, statement) that returns true iff
kb (the knowledge base) entails the statement (a logical sentence) and
false otherwise. Write pseudocode that, using function f, defines a
function g(kb, statement) that returns +1 iff the statement is
definitely true given kb, -1 iff the statement is definitely false
given kb, and 0 otherwise.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>Problem 6</h2>
10 points.<br>
<br>
Write pseudocode for a function extract_symbols(statement) that
extracts the list of all unique symbols appearing in statement, where
statement is a logical expression. What is the base case for
extract_symbols? What are the recursive cases? Your function should
work with arbitrarily complex statements following the syntax specified
in <a href="pa3.html">programming assignment 3</a>.<br>
<br>
Your pseudocode should assume that the statement has already been
stored in an object of type logical_expression, as defined in sample
code file <a href="pa3_files/check_true_false.h">check_true_false.h</a>
from programming assignment 3. Your
pseudocode should use the member variables "connective", "symbol", and
"subexpressions" of class logical_expression.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>Problem 7</h2>
25 points.<br>
<br>
Suppose that you have an omniscient function f(symbol) that tells you
for any symbol in your wumpus world whether that symbol is true or
false in that world. Write pseudocode that, using that function,
defines a recursive function g(statement) that can always tell if
statement is true or false, and works for any statement (however
complex it may be) defined using the propositional logic syntax of
programming assignment 3. Remember that only six connectors are defined
in that syntax: and, or, xor, not, if, and iff.<br>
<br>
What is the base case for function g? Which are the recursive cases?
How many recursive cases are there?<br>
<br>
As in problem 6, your pseudocode should assume that the statement has
already been stored in an object of type logical_expression, as defined
in sample code file <a href="pa3_files/check_true_false.h">check_true_false.h</a>
from <a href="pa3.html">programming assignment 3</a>.
Your pseudocode should use the member variables "connective", "symbol",
and "subexpressions" of class logical_expression. The pseudocode should
be specific enough to show exactly how to deal with each connective.<br>
