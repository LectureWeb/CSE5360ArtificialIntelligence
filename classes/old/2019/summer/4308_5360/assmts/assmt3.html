<h1>Assignment 3<br>
</h1>

<h2>Written Assignment - Predicate Logic &amp; Planning</h2>

<br>

<hr>
<h2> Task 1 (CSE 4308: 15 Points; CSE 5360: 15 points)</h2>

<p>Consider a knowledge base with these facts:
</p>

<ul>

  <li> There is a dog called Shadow.
  </li>
  <li> John gave Shadow to Mary.
  </li>
  <li> If Shadow is male, Mary gave a smartphone to John.
  </li>
  <li> If Shadow is female, Mary gave John a laptop.
  </li>
  <li> John only gives male dogs to people (Interpret it as if John
gives dogs to people they are male).
  </li>
  <li> Mary gave John a laptop.
  </li>
</ul>

Convert the above knowledge-base to a first-order logic knowledge base.
For each predicate, function, constant, or variable that you use,
explicitly state:
<ul>

  <li> What type of entity it is (is it a predicate, function,
constant, or variable).
  </li>
  <li> What its semantics are (what it means).</li>
</ul>

<br>

<hr><br>

<h2> Task 2 (CSE 4308: 5 Points; CSE 5360: 5 points)</h2>

Try and unifiy the following predicates(if possible)<br>

<pre style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px;">taller(John, y), taller(x, Son(x))<br><br>taller(y, Barry), taller(Barry, x)<br><br>taller(x, Jane), taller(Bob, Jane)<br><br>taller(Son(x), Jane), taller(Bob, Jane)<br><br>taller(Barry, John), taller(x, y)<br><br></pre>

<hr><br>

<h2> Task 3 (CSE 4308: 10 Points; CSE 5360: 10 points)</h2>

List all the symbols required to convert the given KB to Propositional
Logic. Your symbols should be comprehensive enough that any statement
using the predicates and constants used in the KB below can be
converted. Also convert the given KB<br>

<pre style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px;">Faster(Sam, John)<br>for-all x,y: Taller(x,y) &lt;=&gt; Faster(y,x) <br></pre>

Show the the following KB entails
<pre style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px;">Taller(John,Sam)</pre>

by propositionalization<br>

<h2> Task 4 (CSE 4308: 30 Points; CSE 5360: 30 points) </h2>

The task in this programming assignment is to design appropriate
descriptions of facts, actions, and goals, using the PDDL language,
for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Tower of
Hanoi problem</a>. You will
use your descriptions as inputs to a Graphplan implementation. If your
descriptions are correct, Graphplan will produce appropriate plans.
<h3> Compiling and Running the Software </h3>

The Graphplan software can be downloaded from <a href="assmt3_files/graphplan.zip">graphplan.zip</a>.
See
the README file in that package for additional information. To compile
the software on <tt>omega</tt>, unzip the directory, and,
from that directory, type
<pre>make graphplan<br></pre>

Once the program compiles, it can be invoked from the commandline as
follows:
<pre>graphplan -o [operators_file] -f [facts_file]<br></pre>

For example:
<pre>graphplan -o block_ops.txt -f block_facts3.txt<br></pre>

<ul>

  <li>Argument <tt>operators_file</tt> specifies the
location of a text file containing definitions of actions. For example,
see <a href="assmt3_files/block_ops.txt">block_ops.txt</a>
for definitions of actions appropriate for the blocks world domain. </li>
  <li>Argument <tt>facts_file</tt> specifies the
location of a text file containing definitions of facts about the
environment, including objects (and types for those objects), general
predicates that are always true, initial state description, and goal
description. For example, see <a href="assmt3_files/block_facts2.txt">block_facts2.txt</a>,
    <a href="assmt3_files/block_facts3.txt">block_facts3.txt</a>,
and <a href="assmt3_files/block_facts4.txt">block_facts4.txt</a>
for example fact descriptions for the blocks world domain. </li>
</ul>

Once you start running the software, it will ask you three questions.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Just hit enter for each
question</span>, so as to use the default settings. If
your descriptions of actions and facts are correct, the program will
print out a plan achieving the stated goal.
<p>Note that the preconds in each fact file will contain both
statements that are always true in that domain (i.e., in the Tower of
Hanoi domain or the blocks world domain), and statements that simply
describe the initial state for that specific planning problem. In
addition to the facts files for the specific planning problems you are
given, you will have to create a separate text file that includes all
the statements that must be present in ANY facts file for that domain.
</p>

<h3>Tower of Hanoi Description</h3>

A description of the Tower of Hanoi domain can be found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi">Wikipedia</a>.
In all problems that your program will be tested with there will be
five discs (called disk1, disk2, disk3, disk4, disk5) and three pegs
(called A, B, C). In all your facts files you will have to include both
a common part (defining objects and relations among objects) and a
plan-specific part (describing the initial state and goal for each
plan). Note that some of the five disks may not appear in some of the
planning problems.
<p>The two planning problems you have to solve are:
</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1</strong>
</p>

<pre>initial state:<br>(on disk1 disk2)<br>(on disk2 A) <br>(clear disk1)<br>(clear B)<br>(clear C) <br><br>goal:<br>(on disk1 B)<br>(on disk2 C)</pre>

<strong>Problem 2</strong>
<pre>initial state:<br>(on disk1 disk2) <br>(on disk2 disk3)<br>(on disk3 disk4)<br>(on disk4 disk5)<br>(on disk5 C) <br>(clear disk1) <br>(clear A) <br>(clear B)<br><br>goal:<br>(on disk1 disk2) <br>(on disk2 disk3)<br>(on disk3 disk4)<br>(on disk4 disk5)<br>(on disk5 A) <br></pre>

<h3> Grading </h3>

This task will be graded for 30 points.
Specifically, the point allocation is:
<ul>

  <li>15 points: defining facts and actions correctly. The
language that you define (i.e., the actions, objects, and general
statements that are always true) should be sufficient not only for the
specific plans that you are required to construct, but also for any
other planning problems that we can define in the Tower of Hanoi
domain. As part of grading, we will also test your
solutions on planning problems that we will make up. </li>
  <li>15 points: solving the planning problems
you
are given&nbsp; + 1 additional problem per domain. You get 5 points for
each
problem. If you solve all 3
correctly, you get 15 points.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task 5 (CSE 4308: 25 Points; CSE 5360: 20 points)</h2>

Three adults and three children are on the left side of the river. Each
adult
weighs 150 pounds. Each child has half the weight of an adult, so each
child weighs 75 pounds. They all want to cross to the right side of the
river. However, the only means of transportation they can use is a
boat, and the boat can carry a maximum of 150 pounds. Thus, the boat
can carry one adult without children, or one child, or two children.
Any adult or child can operate the boat, but the boat cannot be
operated without having at least one person on the boat. The goal is to
come up with a plan for moving everyone from the left side to the right
side using multiple boat trips.
<br>

<br>

Describe the initial state and the goal, using PDDL.
Define
appropriate actions for this planning problem, in the PDDL language.
For each action, provide a name, arguments, preconditions, and effects.
Also, give a complete plan (using the actions described) for getting
from the start to the goal state<br>

<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Task 6 (CSE 4308: 15 Points; CSE 5360: 10 points)</h2>

Suppose that we are using PDDL to describe facts and actions in a
certain world called JUNGLE. In the JUNGLE world there are 5
predicates, each predicate takes at most 3 arguments, and there are 4
constants. Give a reasonably tight bound on the number of unique states
in the JUNGLE world. Justify your answer.<br>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;"><br>
</span>
<hr>
<h2>Task 7 (CSE 4308: 10 Points (EC); CSE 5360: 10 points)</h2>

Consider the problem in Task 5. Let us say that, if there is only one
person in the boat, the boat can be blown off course and end up back on
the side it originally started from. How would you modify the actions
you described in Task 2 to account for this if you were going to try
and handle this scenario by<br>

<ul>

  <li>Execution Monitoring/Online Replanning</li>
  <li>Conditional Planning</li>
</ul>

In both cases, show what the modifications are (If no modification is
necessary, Justify).
