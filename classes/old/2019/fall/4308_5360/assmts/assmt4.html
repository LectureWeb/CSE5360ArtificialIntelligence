<h2>Task 1 (CSE 4308: 30 Points; CSE 5360: 25 points)</h2>
Three adults and three children are on the left side of the river. Each
adult
weighs 150 pounds. Each child has half the weight of an adult, so each
child weighs 75 pounds. They all want to cross to the right side of the
river. However, the only means of transportation they can use is a
boat, and the boat can carry a maximum of 225 pounds. Thus, the boat
can carry one adult, one adult and one child, one child or two
children.
Any adult or child can operate the boat, but the boat cannot be
operated without having at least one person on the boat. The goal is to
come up with a plan for moving everyone from the left side to the right
side using multiple boat trips.
<br>
<br>
Describe the initial state and the goal, using PDDL.
Define
appropriate actions for this planning problem, in the PDDL language.
For each action, provide a name, arguments, preconditions, and effects.
Also, give a complete plan (using the actions described) for getting
from the start to the goal state<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Task 2 (CSE 4308: 30 Points; CSE 5360: 25 points)</h2>
Suppose that we are using PDDL to describe facts and actions in a
certain world called JUNGLE. In the JUNGLE world there are 4
predicates, each predicate takes at most 4 arguments, and there are 5
constants. Give a reasonably tight bound on the number of unique states
in the JUNGLE world. Justify your answer.<br>

<h2>Task 3 (CSE 4308: 15 Points; CSE 5360: 10 points)</h2>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">We
have state descriptions and action definitions written following the
conventions used in the graphplan software of Optional Assignment 1. One of the
actions is defined as follows:</p>
<pre style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">(operator<br> aaa<br> (params<br> (&lt;b&gt; ttt1) (&lt;c&gt; ttt1))<br> (preconds<br> (ppp1 &lt;b&gt; &lt;c&gt;) (ppp2 &lt;b&gt;) (ppp3 &lt;c&gt;))<br> (effects<br> (eee1 &lt;b&gt; &lt;c&gt;) (eee2 &lt;b&gt;) (del eee3 &lt;c&gt;)))<br></pre>
Suppose
we are at a state S1 described as follows (again, using graphplan
syntax):<br>
<pre style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">(A ttt1)<br>(B ttt1)<br>(C ttt1)<br>(ppp1 B C)<br>(ppp2 A)<br>(ppp2 B)<br>(ppp3 C)<br>(eee1 A C)<br>(eee2 C)<br>(eee3 C)<br>(eee3 A)<br></pre>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">What
is the state resulting from applying action aaa(B,C) to S1? Give a
complete specification.</span>&nbsp;<br>

<h2>Task 4 (CSE 4308: 15 Points (EC); CSE 5360: 15 points)</h2>
Consider the problem in Task 1. Let us say that, if there is only one
person in the boat, the boat can be blown off course and end up back on
the side it originally started from. How would you modify the actions
you described in Task 1 to account for this if you were going to try
and handle this scenario by<br>
<ul>
<li>Execution Monitoring/Online Replanning</li>
<li>Conditional Planning</li>
</ul>
In both cases, show what the modifications are (If no modification is
necessary, Justify).&nbsp;
