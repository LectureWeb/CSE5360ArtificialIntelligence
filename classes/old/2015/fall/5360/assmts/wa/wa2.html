<h3> Problem 1 </h3>
10 points.
<p>Consider the following three variants of minimax: the simple
version, alpha-beta search, and depth-limited search, and consider the
games of tic-tac-toe and chess. For each combination of minimax variant
and game, answer the following question: can that minimax variant
possibly never terminate, in computing the best next move? Justify your
answer.</p>

chess, assume that the rules do not impose any limit on the total
number of moves in a game.</span>

Figure 1. A tic-tac-toe board state.
</p>
<p>Consider the tic-tac-toe board state shown in Figure 1. Draw
the full
minimax search tree starting from this state, and ending in terminal
nodes. Show the utility value for each terminal and non-terminal node.
Utility values are +1 if X wins, 0 for a tie, and -1 if O wins. Assume
that X makes the next move.

<h3> Problem 3 </h3>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./wa2_files/minimax1.gif"><br>
<br>
Figure 2. A game search tree.
</p>
<p>a. (10 points)
In the game search tree of Figure 2, indicate what nodes will be pruned
using alpha-beta search, and what the estimated utility values are for
the rest of the nodes. Assume that, when given a choice, alpha-beta
search expands nodes in a left-to-right order. Also, assume the MAX
player plays first.
</p>
<p>b. (10 points) This question is also on the game search tree
of Figure 2. Suppose we are given some additional knowledge about the
game: the maximum utility value is 10, i.e., it is not mathematically
possible for the MAX player to get an outcome greater than 10. How can
this knowledge be used to further improve the efficiency of alpha-beta
search? Indicate the nodes that will be pruned using this improvement.
Again, assume that, when given a choice, alpha-beta search expands
nodes in a left-to-right order, and that the MAX player plays first.

<h3> Problem 4 </h3>
10 points
<p>Suppose that two computer algorithms A and B are playing
tic-tac-toe against each other. Algorithm A is plain minimax search. </p>
<p>a. (5 points). If algorithm B is also plain minimax, does
algorithm A always follow the best possible strategy? </p>
<p>b. (5 points). Can you make up an algorithm B for which
algorithm A (i.e., plain minimax) does not find the best possible
strategy? I.e., can you make up an algorithm B such that, if the
designers of A knew that their opponent uses this algorithm B, the
designers of A could replace minimax with a better strategy?

<h3> Problem 6 </h3>
20 points.<br>
<br>
Suppose that you want to implement an algorithm tht will compete on a
two-player deterministic game of perfect information. Your opponent is
a supercomputer called DeepGreen. DeepGreen does not use Minimax. You
are given a library function DeepGreenMove(S), that takes any state S
as an argument, and returns the move that DeepGreen will choose for
that state S (more precisely, DeepGreenMove (S) returns the state
resulting from the opponent's move).
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px;">Write
an algorithm in pseudocode (following the style of the Minimax
pseudocode) that will always make an optimal decision given the
knowledge we have about DeepGreen. You are free to use the library
function DeepGreenMove(S) in your pseudocode. If you think regular
Minimax is the answer, just state so.</p>
