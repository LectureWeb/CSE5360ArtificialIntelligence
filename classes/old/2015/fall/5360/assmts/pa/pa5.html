<h1>Programming
Assignment 5</h1>
<h3> Summary </h3>
The goal in this assignment is to get practice on designing Bayesian
networks, estimating probability distributions in Bayesian networks,
and implementing Bayesian networks.<br>
<h3> Part 1: Posterior Probablities</h3><strong>30 points<br></strong>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">The
task in this part is to implement a system that:</span>
<ul style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px;">
<li>Can determine the posterior probability of different
hypotheses, given priors for these hypotheses, and given a sequence of
observations.</li>
<li>Can determine the probability that the next observation
will be of a specific type, priors for different hypotheses, and given
a sequence of observations.</li>
</ul>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">As
in the slides that we saw in class, there are five types of bags of
candies. Each bag has an infinite amount of candies. We have one of
those bags, and we are picking candies out of it. We don't know what
type of bag we have, so we want to figure out the probability of each
type based on the candies that we have picked.</span>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px;">The
five possible hypotheses for our bag are:</p>
<ul style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px;">
<li>h<sub>1</sub><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>(prior:
10%): This type of bag contains 100% cherry candies.</li>
<li>h<sub>2</sub><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>(prior:
20%): This type of bag contains 75% cherry candies and 25% lime candies.</li>
<li>h<sub>3</sub><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>(prior:
40%): This type of bag contains 50% cherry candies and 50% lime candies.</li>
<li>h<sub>4</sub><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>(prior:
20%): This type of bag contains 25% cherry candies and 75% lime candies.</li>
<li>h<sub>5</sub><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>(prior:
10%): This type of bag contains 100% lime candies.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line arguments:</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">The
program takes a single command line argument, which is a string, for
example CLLCCCLLL. This string represents a sequence of observations,
i.e., a sequence of candies that we have already picked. Each character
is C if we picked a cherry candy, and L if we picked a lime candy.
Assuming that characters in the string are numbered starting with 1,
the i-th character of the string corresponds to the i-th observation.
The program should be invoked from the commandline as follows:</span>
<pre style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px;">compute_a_posteriori observations<br></pre>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">For
example:</span>
<pre style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px;">compute_a_posteriori CLLCCLLLCCL<br></pre>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">We
also allow the case of not having a command line argument at all, this
represents the case where we have made no observations yet.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Output:</span><br>

program should create a text file called "result.txt", that is
formatted exactly as shown below. ??? is used where your program should
print values that depend on its command line argument. Five decimal
points should appear for any floating point number.</span>

<h3> Part 2: Designing a Bayesian network graph</h3>
<strong>10 points
</strong>
<p>George doesn't watch much TV in the evening, unless there is a
baseball game on. When there is baseball on TV, George is very likely
to watch. George has a cat that he feeds most evenings, although he
forgets every now and then. He's much more likely to forget when he's
watching TV. He's also very unlikely to feed the cat if he has run out
of cat food (although sometimes he gives the cat some of his own food).
Design a Bayesian network for modeling the relations between these four
events:
</p>
<ul>
<li> baseball_game_on_TV
</li>
<li> George_watches_TV
</li>
<li> out_of_cat_food
</li>
<li> George_feeds_cat
</li>
</ul>
Your task is to connect these nodes with arrows pointing from
causes to effects. No programming is needed for this part, just include
an electronic document (PDF, Word file, or OpenOffice document) showing
your Bayesian network design.<br>
<hr>
<h3> Part 3: Learning Probabilities from Training Data</h3>
<strong>20 points
</strong>
<p>For the Bayesian network of Part 1, the text file <a href="pa5_files/training_data.txt">
at this link </a><a>
contains training data from every evening of an entire year. Every line
in this text file corresponds to an evening, and contains four numbers.
Each number is a 0 or a 1. In more detail:
</a></p>
<ul>
<a><li> The first number is 0 if there is no baseball
game on TV, and 1 if there is a baseball game on TV.
</li>
<li> The second number is 0 if George does not watch TV, and 1
if George watches TV.
</li>
<li> The third number is 0 if George is not out of cat food,
and 1 if George is out of cat food.
</li>
<li> The fourth number is 0 if George does not feed the cat,
and 1 if George feeds the cat.
</li>
</a>
</ul>
<a>Based on the data in this file, determine the
probability table for each node in the Bayesian network you have
designed for Part 1. You need to include these four tables in the
drawing that you produce for question 1. You also need to submit the
code/script that computes these probabilities.

<p><strong> Figure 1: A Bayesian network establishing
relations between
events on the burglary-earthquake-alarm domain, together with complete
specifications of all probability distributions.</strong>
</p>
<h3> Part 4: Implementing a Bayesian Network</h3>
<strong>40 points
</strong>
<p>For the Bayesian network of Figure 1, implement a program that
computes
and prints out the probability of any combination of events given any
other combination of events. If the executable is called bnet, here are
some example invocations of the program:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
To print out the probability P(Burglary=true and Alarm=false |
MaryCalls=false).
<pre>bnet Bt Af given Mf<br></pre>
</li>
<li>To print out the probability P(Alarm=false and
Earthquake=true).
<pre>bnet Af Et<br></pre>
</li>
<li>To print out the probability P(JohnCalls=true and
Alarm=false | Burglary=true and Earthquake=false).
<pre>bnet Jt Af given Bt Ef<br></pre>
</li>
<li>To print out the probability P(Burglary=true and
Alarm=false and MaryCalls=false and JohnCalls=true and
Earthquake=true).
<pre>bnet Bt Af Mf Jt Et<br></pre>
</li>
</ol>
In general, bnet takes 1 to 6(no more, no fewer) command line
arguments, as follows:
<ul>
<li> First, there are one to five arguments, each argument
specifying a
variable among Burglary, Earthquake, Alarm, JohnCalls, and MaryCalls
and a value equal to true or false. Each of these arguments is a string
with two letters. The first letter is B (for Burglary), E (for
Earthquake), A (for Alarm), J (for JohnCalls) or M (for MaryCalls). The
second letter is t (for true) or f (for false). These arguments specify
a combination C1 of events whose probability we want to compute. For
example, in the first example above, C1 = (Burglary=true and
Alarm=false), and in the second example above C1 = (Alarm=false and
Earthquake=true).
</li>
<li> Then, optionally, the word "given" follows, followed by
one
to four arguments. Each of these one to four arguments is again a
string with two letters, where, as before the first letter is B (for
Burglary), E (for Earthquake), A (for Alarm), J (for JohnCalls) or M
(for MaryCalls). The second letter is t (for true) or f (for false).
These last arguments specify a combination of events C2 such that we
need to compute the probability of C1 given C2. For example, in the
first example above C2 = (MaryCalls=false), and in the second example
there is no C2, so we simply compute the probability of C1, i.e.,
P(Alarm=false and Earthquake=true).
</li>
</ul>
The implementation should not contain hardcoded values for
all combinations of arguments. Instead, your code should use the tables
shown on Figure 1 and the appropriate formulas to evaluate the
probability of the specified event. It is OK to hardcode values from
the tables on Figure 1 in your code, but it is not OK to hard code
values for all possible command arguments, or probability values for
all possible atomic events.
More specifically, for full credit, the code should include and use a
Bayesian network class. The class should include a member function
called computeProbability(b, e, a, j, m), where each argument is a
boolean, specifying if the corresponding event (burglary, earthquake,
alarm, john-calls, mary-calls) is true or false. This function should
return the joint probability of the five events.<br>

<h3>How to submit</h3>
Submissions should be made using </a><a href="http://elearn.uta.edu/">Blackboard</a>.
<p>Submit a ZIPPED directory called <tt>programming5.zip</tt>
(no
other
forms of compression accepted, contact the instructor or TA if you do
not know how to produce .zip files). The directory should
contain source code, the answer for part 1 in a document, the answer
(and code) for part 2, and the code for part 3. The submission should
also contain a file called
readme.txt,
which should specify precisely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and UTA ID of the student.</li><li>What programming language is used.</li>
<li>How the code is structured.</li>
<li>How to run the code, including very specific compilation
instructions, if compilation is needed. Instructions such as "compile
using g++" are NOT
considered specific. Providing all the command lines that are needed to
complete the compilation on omega is specific.</li>
</ul>
Insufficient or unclear instructions will be penalized by up to 20
points.
Code that does not run on omega machines gets AT MOST half credit (50
points).
